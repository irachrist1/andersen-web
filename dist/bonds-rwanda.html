                        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Bonds are important financial securities, which are used to serve many purposes in the capital structure of any country, including Rwanda, yet, they are less used, despite their impact to the bond issuer, bond holder, national and global economy.

                        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Bonds are important financial securities, which are used to serve many purposes in the capital structure of any country, including Rwanda, yet, they are less used, despite their impact to the bond issuer, bond holder, national and global economy. Bonds offer an opportunity to government, companies or other organizations to obtain funds for different reasons, for instance to finance infrastructure projects, to expand their operations, or to retire current liabilities. Bonds are used in Rwanda mainly by government and other private sectors in developmental growth of the economy. This paper aims at analyzing bonds in Rwanda as well as the kinds of bonds, when the bonds are analyzed according to the guidelines stipulated in the regulation dubbed Regulation No. 15 that governs the issuance of capital market debt securities.</p>

                        <h2 id="debt-security">Meaning of a Debt Security</h2>
                        <p>In Rwandan business context, a debt security is deemed as any contractual or written undertaking to repay a debt<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. This also embraces the government bonds but will also encompass corporate bonds, infrastructure bonds, and any other related security that may be created and recognized by the CMA.</p>

                        <h2 id="bonds">Meaning of Bonds</h2>
                        <p>A bond is an interest-bearing financial instrument and represents a borrower's promise to pay back borrowed funds, referred to as face value or principal, plus the interest on the borrowed funds â€“ interest is usually paid at regular intervals referred to as coupon payments. Bonds are used to ensure that entities can funding from investors and commit to pay the principal amount together with interest on the bond, at specified time.</p>

                        <p>In Rwandan context, Regulation No: 15 on Bond Issuance was developed by Capital Market Authority CMA, in a way offers a structure guideline on bond issuance. In the regulation, a debt security refers to a "contractual or written undertaking to repay a debt". This consists of Government Treasury Bonds, Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Infrastructure Bonds and all other Bonds approved by the capital market authority (CMA).</p>

                        <h2 id="types">Types of Bonds under Rwandan Capital Market Authority</h2>
                        <p>Rwanda has bond market that contains different kinds of bonds with different issues, a goal of each of these bonds varying from the other and issued by different bodies. These bonds enable issuers to secure much wanted funds required in their operations while on the other hand, investors can also earn their cash investments.</p>

                        <h3>Government Treasury Bonds</h3>
                        <p>These are treasury bonds that are floated in the market by the government, to meet its budget requirements mostly in the provision of infrastructure and essential service deliver. Most of them are classified as low risk due to the full faith and credit support that government bonds have. It is one of the measures used by the government through which it raises money to fund development objectives in any country.</p>

                        <h3>Municipal Bonds</h3>
                        <p>Local government authorities use municipal bonds to finance regional infrastructure items such as roads, hospitals, and schools. A variety of public infrastructure projects, such as water supply systems, solid waste management, drainage systems, sewerage and sanitation services, housing development, and the building and renovation of roads, bridges, and flyovers, can be funded with the money raised from the issuance of municipal bonds. Funds may also be used to finance urban transportation projects, all of which are essential for promoting urban growth, boosting public health, and raising Rwandans' standard of living in general.</p>

                        <h3>Corporate Bonds</h3>
                        <p>Corporate bonds are one of the financial tools that private sector firms employ to finance business growth, acquisitions, or to replace existing debt. By purchasing corporate bonds, investors are lending money to the bond issuer. In exchange, the business legally agrees to pay interest on the principal and, typically, to repay the principal when the bond matures.</p>

                        <p>As an example, The Energicotel "ECTL" PLC bond, which was introduced on the Rwanda Stock Exchange on August 9, 2021, is an illustration of a corporate bond in Rwanda. By issuing a 13.5% fixed interest rate on the first tranche of a Frw 6.5 billion bond, the corporation was able to raise Frw 3.5 billion. The money was utilized for bond-related costs, power plant investments, and refinancing, demonstrating the increasing interest of investors in Rwanda's financial markets.</p>

                        <p>Corporate bonds can also be issued in a form of green bonds, but with a specific focus on funding environmentally sustainable projects. Under this framework, Prime Energy Plc has successfully raised 9.58 billion Rwandan francs in its debut green bond issuance, exceeding its 9.5 billion target. The bond, now listed on the Rwanda Stock Exchange.</p>

                        <h3>Infrastructure Bonds</h3>
                        <p>These are financial instruments known as infrastructure bonds that are issued primarily to draw capital for long-term development initiatives that are vital to a country's infrastructure. Usually, these projects involve building and maintaining important public infrastructure, like ports, railroads, highways, and utilities. Corporate infrastructure bonds and municipal special-purpose bonds are two examples of the several types of infrastructure bonds that are issued internationally.</p>

                        <h3>Other Related Debt Securities</h3>
                        <p>The CMA may approve other forms of debt securities, including innovative instruments, among others.</p>

                        <h2 id="legal-framework">Legal Framework for Bond Issuance in Rwanda</h2>
                        <p>The market of bonds in Rwanda is regulated by Regulation No. 15 that contains clear procedures and conditions for bonds' emission. This regulation has been developed to check bond issuance in Rwanda and to make it as positive for both issuers and investors as possible.</p>

                        <h3>Free Transferability of Debt Securities</h3>
                        <p>A debt security can be transferred to another person/entity. For security to be issued to the public, it should be of an entirely negotiable character and should be easily transferable. This provides a ready market in the bonds and all the investors in the bond can carry out trading in the bonds the way they please. Nevertheless, there are certain cases which do not follow this trend. For instance, combined with statutory prohibitions of transfers or restrictions set by CMA, transfer of bonds may be limited, especially in the case of securities of mutual organizations. These provisions aim at creating a blend between market depth and special kinds of investors/sectors.</p>

                        <h3>Minimum Number of Debt Holders</h3>
                        <p>According to Article 7 of Regulation No. 15, before bonds can be listed on the RSE, there has to be at least seven independent holders of the bonds. They may not be a director, a substantial shareholder or an associate of the issuer. It also makes the market more liquid and transparent with regard to the ownership of the bonds provided for herein. Since the regulation of the bond market enjoins a minimum number of independent bondholders, it has the effect of minimizing concentration of ownership, which is equally disruptive of the bond market.</p>

                        <h3>Minimum Capital and Assets for Issuers</h3>
                        <p>Section P in Article 8 of Regulation No. 15 also mentions the capital and assets threshold for those issuers who intend to offer bonds in the public market. For companies that are not floats on Rwandan stock exchange the regulation requires an issued capital of half a billion Rwandan francs and net worth of not less than one billion Rwandan francs. These thresholds help to make sure that the issuers that are coming to the market are quite solid and capable of managing the funds through bond sale. Further, each bond that is issued must have a nominal value of not less than one million Rwanda Francs although the CMA may by notice in the Gazette, prescribe a different amount.</p>

                        <p>In addition, if they are identical in every respect with previous issues of the same author is can be issued without meeting the minimum capital requirements for future issues.</p>

                        <h2 id="tax-treatment">Tax Treatment of Debt Securities under Rwandan Legal Framework</h2>

                        <h3>For Bond Issuers</h3>
                        <p>For bond issuers, interest payments made to bondholders are considered deductible expenses. This means that a taxpayer issuing bonds can reduce their taxable income by the amount of interest paid on their debt securities. This ensures that issuers can optimize their tax liabilities while accessing the necessary capital for expansion, infrastructure development, or debt refinancing.</p>

                        <p>In addition, Bonds are not subject to Value Added Tax (VAT) since they are neither good nor services. Instead, bonds are classified as financial instruments used for raising capital, representing a debt obligation rather than a tangible product or service transaction.</p>

                        <h3>For Bond Investors</h3>
                        <p>Income earned from bond investments, particularly interest payments, is subject to taxation. For resident investors in Rwanda or the East African Community (EAC), a withholding tax of 5% applies to bond interest to the bonds that are listed on the Capital Market Authority. Also, Interests derived from treasury bonds with a maturity of at least three (3) years are subject to a 5% withholding tax (WHT) in Rwanda. This means that the bond issuer applies a rate of 5% to an interest on a bond and remit to the Rwanda Revenue Authority, resulting to a net of 95% of gross interest rate, receivable by a bond issuer.</p>

                        <p>However, if the investor is a resident of Rwanda but has not filed a recent income tax declaration, the withholding tax increases to 15%. Additionally, if the bond issuer is a foreign entity or a non-resident individual, interest payments on interest on bonds will be subject to a 15% withholding tax. In addition, The net interest income received after withholding tax is also subject to being added to the investor's overall annual taxable income, meaning additional tax liabilities may arise depending on their total earnings for the year.</p>

                        <h2 id="bonds-vs-loans">Why Bonds not Loans?</h2>
                        <p>Bonds and other debt securities differ significantly from traditional loans in terms of structure, risk distribution, and market dynamics. Unlike traditional bank loans, which involve a direct agreement between a borrower and a lender (typically a financial institution), bonds allow issuers such as governments and corporations to raise capital from multiple investors in the financial markets. This means that rather than relying on a single lender, bond issuers can access a larger pool of funds, often at more competitive interest rates. Additionally, bonds are structured with predefined maturity dates and periodic interest (coupon) payments, providing greater flexibility for both issuers and investors compared to the fixed repayment schedules of traditional loans. The ability to trade bonds on secondary markets also adds liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell them before maturity, which is not the case with conventional bank loans.</p>

                        <p>Another key distinction is the regulatory and tax advantages associated with bonds. interest payments on bonds are tax-deductible expenses for issuers, reducing their overall tax liability. In addition, capital gains from bonds are exempted from taxation.</p>

                        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Bonds play a vital role in Rwanda's financial landscape, offering a versatile and effective means of financing for both government and corporate entities. They provide a structured approach to raising capital, enabling issuers to fund essential infrastructure projects, business expansions, and debt refinancing. For investors, bonds, especially government bonds, offer relatively low-risk, predictable returns, making them an attractive option despite the tax liabilities on interest income. The regulatory framework in Rwanda, as outlined in Regulation No. 15, facilitates a transparent and secure bond market, ensuring investor protection and promoting liquidity. However, challenges such as market awareness and liquidity still persist, but these can be mitigated through increased education and the development of more sustainable investment instruments, such as green bonds. Ultimately, the growing bond market in Rwanda contributes significantly to the country's economic development and presents promising opportunities for both issuers and investors.</p>
